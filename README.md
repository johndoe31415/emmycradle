# emmycradle
This is a electronically actuated baby cradle for my baby daughter Emmy. It
needed to be put together *really* quick, so it uses an Olimex AVR-MT128
development board connected to a Pololu A4988 stepper motor driver. It drives a
unipolar stepper motor that I've had around and pulls periodically in one
direction and then releases the motor so that gravity can bring back the baby
cradle in its original position.
